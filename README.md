# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## What is it
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) means managing and provisioning infrastructure using code instead of manual processes, a common one is Terraform.

## Why should we use it
Using IaC ensures consistency, scalability, and faster deployments by automating infrastructure setup, this is because once you have the configurations file working you can recreate infrastructure by reusing them which is faster, avoids human error and can be automated further with cicd pipelines.

## When to use it
Use IaC when you need frequent deployments, dynamic environments, or large-scale infrastructure management.

## Where to use it
IaC can be used in cloud environments, on-premises data centers, and containerized environments.

## Tools available for IaC
Popular tools for IaC include Terraform, Ansible, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager Templates, and Google Cloud Deployment Manager.

## What is Ansible and benefits
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management and deployment. It's agentless, uses a declarative language (YAML), and has a large community for support.
